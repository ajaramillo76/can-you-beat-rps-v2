* As a gamer who occasionally enjoys a simple game, that I remember from my childhood and is still challenging enough that it lets me play against a computer that uses machine learning.

* As a gambler, I think that I have the "skill" to beat the odds and I am addicted to the adrenaline rush of gambling.

* As a statistics major, despite many studies done on human predictability, I believe I have the randomness and ability to beat the computer and believe that the human brain is still superior to a computer.

* As a kid who likes easy games, I like that it can keep me occupied for long periods of time.
